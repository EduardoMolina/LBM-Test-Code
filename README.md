# ATTENTION #
This repository will be renamed 3rd/4th March 2016 to allow for the introduction of a 3D test code in MATLAB which may affect fetch and pull requests.


# README #
This is a 2D, single grid test code for LBM written in MATLAB to serve as an introduction to the method using an implementation that resembles the full multi-grid parallel code.

## NOTES ##
The code contains no boundary conditions other than periodicity applied on all 4 edges.

## CONTRIBUTIONS ##
The goal of the code is to remain as simple as possible to serve as an introduction. Please fork this repository and build on the code as required on the fork to preserve the master.
